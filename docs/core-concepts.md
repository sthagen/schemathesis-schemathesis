# Core Concepts

Hereâ€™s an overview of how Schemathesis works:

1. **Test Generation**: Using the API schema to create a test generator that you can fine-tune to your requirements.
2. **Execution and Adaptation**: Sending tests to the API and adapting through statistical models and heuristics to optimize test cases based on responses.
3. **Analysis and Minimization**: Checking responses for issues and simplifying failing test cases for easier debugging.
4. **Stateful Testing**: Running multi-step tests to assess API operations in both isolated and integrated scenarios.
5. **Reporting**: Generating detailed reports with insights and cURL commands for easy issue reproduction.
